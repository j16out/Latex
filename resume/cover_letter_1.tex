\opening{To Whom this May Concern,} 

My Goal is to become an assistant researcher within the prestigious organization of SNOLAB, while learning and gaining experience for my future goal of pursuing a career in Particle Physics. I am a 4th year Physics Major at Thompson Rivers University and know my background and experience will allow me to be an asset to your organization.
I have completed a number of projects involving delicate, technical design and precise assembly. For a directed studies project I designed and professionally constructed operational sensors for a high altitude balloon using a LPKF circuit milling machine and Eagle CAD drafting software. The circuits included a GPS telemetry transmitter and receiver, a cosmic radiation detector, accelerometer and atmospheric sensors all designed as Arduino shields. The Project required a great deal of patience and analytical debugging. This experience combined with my education and hardworking nature will be a valuable asset to SNOLAB.
Summer 2013 I received an undergraduate research award (UREAP) from Thompson Rivers University in which I re-designed and fabricated RFID sensing equipment for animal detection. The project involved managing a \$1000 budget and working with biological researchers to technically design and construction more than 25 circuit boards using surface mounted technology. The project required a great deal of patience and attention to detail in order to assure all units were precisely milled, assembled and tested to exceed the requirements outlined by the client.  The project required a large amount of work with programing PICâ€™s which I know combined with my experience with C++ and other languages will be of great value to SNOLAB.

I hope to hear from you soon to discuss how I can become a valued member of your organization.  I look forward to starting my researching career, as well as pursuing opportunities for professional development and advancement within SNOLAB. Thank you for your kind consideration of my qualifications.  

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
