As you can see from my attached resume, I developed my engineering and design skills through several research and co-op positions.
 
%I am writing to apply for a position on the UBC Rocket engineering design team. I welcome the opportunity to bring my mechanical and engineering skills to the UBC Rocket team.

I am writing to apply for scholarship and award opportunities offered through University of British Columbia. I welcome the opportunity to discuss my mechanical and engineering skills as well as the opportunities I have had to develop them. As you can see from my attached resume, I developed my engineering and design skills through several research and co-op related positions.

During summer and fall 2015, I worked on the development of the M9 prototype muon spectrometer currently being designed and built at TRIUMF. Under the supervision of Dr. Syd Kreitzman, I designed and constructed a beamline muon spectrometer used for testing prototype sensors and DAQ electronics. In addition to producing professional 3D models and drawings in Solidworks I also designed a photon propagation simulation and visualizer to determine the resolution of the new spectrometer for different geometrical configurations of scintillation pieces. My work at TRIUMF has enabled me to refine my engineering and programming abilities which will be an asset for my future career goals.% in aerospace. 

In the Summer of 2014 I worked at SNOLAB under the supervision of Dr. Christine Kraus on the SNO+ experiment. During my term I spent a great deal of time engineering solutions to correct the slippage issues plaguing the umbilical retrieval mechanisms, a device responsible for lowering radioactive sources into the multi-million dollar detector. In addition to designing high-traction pulleys, I also designed and fabricated a chain-drive system which successfully met budget, space and radioactivity requirements. My time with SNOLAB has given me great technical experience that I believe combined with my mechanical intuitiveness and knowledge of physics will aid me during my professional career.

For a research position during the summer of 2013, I was involved in the design and production of RFID bird tracking equipment for the Thompson Rivers University Biology Department. The project required the fabrication and delicate assembly of over 20 SMT circuit boards and dispensing platforms. In addition I also designed software in C/C++ using cURL libraries to couple all electrical components to a Raspberry Pi device for wireless data communication to a local server. My time at Thompson Rivers University has given me hands-on experience which coupled with my problem solving capabilities will be invaluable towards my professional career.


% For a directed studies project at Thompson Rivers University I designed and constructed operational sensors for a high altitude balloon using a LPKF circuit milling machine and Eagle CAD drafting software. The quality circuits included a transmitter/receiver interface, GPS telemetry APRS transmitter, a cosmic radiation detector, accelerometer and atmospheric sensors all designed as Arduino shields. Thompson Rivers University has given me hands-on experience which coupled with my problem solving capabilities will be invaluable towards my professional career.
 

%I welcome the opportunity for an interview to demonstrate and discuss how I can become a valued member of your organization.
%Based on my understanding of the job responsibilities listed my salary expectations would fall in the range of \$30,000 to \$50,000 annually. 
I look forward to starting my career, as well as pursuing opportunities for professional development and advancement within University of British Columbia. Thank you for your kind consideration of my qualifications.
