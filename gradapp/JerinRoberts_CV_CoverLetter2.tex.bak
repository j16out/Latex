I am writing to apply for the Junior Production Technician position offered at TRIUMF. I welcome the opportunity to bring my mechanical and engineering skills to the TRIUMF team. As you can see from my attached resume, I developed my fabrication and engineering skills through several research and co-op positions. 

During summer and fall 2015, I was involved in the development of the M9 prototype muon spectrometer currently being designed and built at TRIUMF. Under the supervision of Dr. Syd Kreitzman, I designed and constructed a mock muon spectrometer used for testing prototype sensors and DAQ electronics. This work required producing professional 3D models and drawings in Solidworks for both the on-site machine shop and 3D printer. My work at TRIUMF has enabled me to refine my engineering and programming abilities which will be an asset for my future career goals. 

In the Summer of 2014 I worked at SNOLAB under the supervision of Dr. Christine Kraus on the SNO+ experiment. During my term I spent a great deal of time engineering solutions to correct the slippage issues plaguing the umbilical retrieval mechanisms, a device responsible for lowering radioactive sources into the multi-million dollar detector. In addition to designing high-traction pulleys, I also designed and fabricated a chain-drive system which successfully met budget, space and radioactivity requirements. My time with SNOLAB has given me great technical experience that I believe combined with my mechanical intuitiveness and knowledge of physics will aid me during my professional career.

 For a directed studies project at Thompson Rivers University I designed and constructed operational sensors for a high altitude balloon using a LPKF circuit milling machine and Eagle CAD drafting software. The quality circuits included a transmitter/receiver interface, GPS telemetry APRS transmitter, a cosmic radiation detector, accelerometer and atmospheric sensors all designed as Arduino shields. Thompson Rivers University has given me hands-on experience which coupled with my problem solving capabilities will be invaluable towards my professional career.
 
Based on my understanding of the job responsibilities listed my salary expectations would fall in the range of \$30,000 to \$50,000. I hope to hear from you soon to discuss how I can become a valued member of your organization. I look forward to starting my career, as well as pursuing opportunities for professional development and advancement within TRIUMF. Thank you for your kind consideration of my qualifications.
