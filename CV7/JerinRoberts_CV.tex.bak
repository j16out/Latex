My goal is to become a student within the University of Victoria, while learning and gaining experience for my future dreams of pursuing a career in Aerospace Engineering. My educational background and research experience will allow me to become a valued member of your institution.

During Fall 2014, I was involved in the development of the M9 prototype muon spectrometer currently being designed and built at TRIUMF. Under the supervision of Dr. Syd Kreitzman, I designed universal equipment used for testing specific experimental components, which involved generating professional models and drawings using Solidworks. I also designed a sophisticated simulation in C++/ROOT used to help determine the resolution of the new spectrometer given different geometrical configurations for scintillation pieces. In addition I wrote scripts to detect and characterize pulses during SiPM characterization phases in C++/ROOT. My work at TRIUMF has enabled me to refine my engineering and programming abilities which will be an asset for my future career goals. 

In the Summer of 2014 I worked at SNOLAB under the supervision of Dr. Christine Kraus on the
SNO+ experiment. During my term I spent a great deal of time engineering mechanical systems for the project. Specifically I cleverly fixed the slippage issues plaguing the umbilical retrieval mechanisms, a device responsible for lowering radioactive sources into the multi-million dollar detector. In addition to redesigning high-traction pulleys, I also designed and fabricated a chain-drive system which successfully met budget, space and radioactivity requirements. My time with SNOLAB has given me great technical experience that I believe combined with my mechanical intuitiveness and knowledge of physics will aid me during my professional development and advancement within engineering.

 For a directed studies project at Thompson Rivers University I designed and professionally constructed operational sensors for a high altitude balloon using a LPKF circuit milling machine and Eagle CAD drafting software. The circuits included a transmitter/receiver interface, GPS telemetry APRS transmitter, a cosmic radiation detector, accelerometer and atmospheric sensors all designed as Arduino shields. The Project required a great deal of electronic design and debugging. Thompson Rivers University has given me hands-on experience which coupled with my analytical and strategic nature will be invaluable towards my professional career

I hope to hear from you soon to discuss how I can become a valued member of your institution. I look forward to starting my Engineering career, as well as pursuing opportunities for professional development and advancement within University of Victoria. Thank you for your kind consideration of my qualifications.
