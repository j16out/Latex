I am pleased to recommend Richard Taylor as a recipient of the TRU Teaching Award at Thompson Rivers University. Richard has been a teacher and mentor in many of my classes during the past four years, so I have learned a great deal about him and his abilities, and I know he would be well deserving of this award.

Richard has taught me in a number of courses, the most memorable being Differential Equations 1 (2011) and Advance Mechanics (2014). As a Physics student I was very pleased with Richards teaching style. With a relaxed and comfortable teaching environment he always easily explained complex concepts coherently with enthusiasm. Richard was always great at tailoring lessons to fit the needs of the individuals in class whether they were studying physics, math or economics. I recall his classes were often challenging but rewarding, and in contrast to many other courses, I always seemed solidify the difficult material in his classes more effectively.  

Due to his vast knowledge and great aptitude for teaching, Richard would be an excellent candidate for the TRU Teaching Award. I believe he will continue to be a great mentor at Thompson Rivers University, and I have no doubts that his abilities and determination for teaching will continue to grow.
